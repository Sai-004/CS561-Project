# Anonymous Trash Collection Robot

This project implements an autonomous trash collection robot using PyBullet for simulation. The robot navigates a virtual environment to collect colored cylinders (representing trash) and sorts them into appropriate bins. The project includes two implementations:

1. **CNN and RL Implementation**: Combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object classification with Reinforcement Learning (RL) for decision-making.
2. **Object Detection in PyBullet Implementation**: Uses depth-based object detection and a CNN to identify and collect trash, with RL for tray placement.

The project is organized into two folders, each containing a complete implementation with its own simulation environment.

## Project Structure

- **cnn_and_rl/**: Contains the CNN and RL implementation.
  - `world.py`: Main script to run the simulation.
  - `robot.py`: Defines the `Robot` class with CNN-based classification and RL logic.
  - Other supporting files (e.g., trained CNN model, URDF models).
- **object_detection_in_pybullet/**: Contains the object detection implementation.
  - `world.py`: Main script to run the simulation.
  - `robot.py`: Defines the `Robot` class with depth-based detection and RL-based placement.
  - Other supporting files (e.g., trained CNN model, URDF models).
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for both implementations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A virtual environment (recommended)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (or download the project files):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CS561-Project
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This installs the required packages: `pybullet`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`, and `tensorflow`.

## Running the Implementations

Each implementation can be run by navigating to its respective folder and executing the `world.py` script. Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running the commands.

### 1. CNN and RL Implementation
This implementation uses a CNN to classify trash (red, green, blue cylinders) and RL to decide where to place them in a tray.

**Steps**:
```bash
cd cnn_and_rl
python world.py
```

**What to Expect**:
- A PyBullet simulation window opens, showing an R2D2-like robot.
- The robot navigates to detect and collect cylinders, classifying them using the CNN.
- Cylinders are sorted into a tray behind the robot based on RL decisions.
- Console output shows classification results, RL actions, and simulation status.

### 2. Object Detection in PyBullet Implementation
This implementation uses depth-based detection to locate trash, ignoring the brown floor, and a CNN for classification, with RL for tray placement.

**Steps**:
```bash
cd object_detection_in_pybullet
python world.py
```

**What to Expect**:
- A PyBullet simulation window opens, showing the same R2D2-like robot.
- The robot uses depth images to detect cylinders, filters out the floor, and classifies them with the CNN.
- Cylinders are placed in a partitioned tray using RL-based actions.
- Console output logs detection details, classification results, and RL updates.

## Requirements
The `requirements.txt` file includes:
```
opencv-python==4.11.0.86
pybullet==3.2.7
tensorflow==2.19.0
```
These packages cover all dependencies needed for both implementations. `numpy` is installed automatically as a dependency of `opencv-python` and `tensorflow`.

## Notes
- **Environment**: Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
- **Simulation**: The PyBullet GUI may require a display. If running on a server, consider using a virtual display or headless mode.
- **Model Files**: Ensure the `GarbageCollectorCNN.h5` model file is present in both folders, as itâ€™s used for cylinder classification.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter version conflicts, try updating `requirements.txt` with compatible versions or installing packages without version pins (e.g., `pip install opencv-python`).
